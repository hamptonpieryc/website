                This year the Club will be running Open Days on Saturday 20<sup>th</sup> May and Saturday 3<sup>rd</sup>
                June from around 11AM to 4PM. There will be free tea and coffee plus snacks and cakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Open Days are an opportunity to see the Club, talk to members and, if the weather is kind, get out
                sailing with an experienced sailor. We have spare life jackets, so
                all you need is suitable clothing to wear in the boat - "suitable" of course does depend on the weather,
                however as a minimum we recommend old shoes/trainers, a change of clothing in case you get wet and a splash
                proof top. Unfortunately we don't have spare wetsuits, but of course you can bring your own.
            </p>
            <p>There is no need to book, but feel free to <a href="contact-us">Contact Us</a> before hand if you have
                any specific questions.
