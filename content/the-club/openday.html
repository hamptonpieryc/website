                Our "official" Open Days are now over foe 2023, however we do plan to run some mini "Discover Sailing"
                sessions
                as part of our regular sailing. Dates and times will depend upon the weather and the availability
                of experienced helms, so keep an eyo on the website,
                Instagram and Facebook for new. Or just <a href="contact-us">Contact Us</a> to register and we will let you
                know when a session is planned.
            </p>

                Even though we couldn't get sailing due to the persistent strong northerly, we had one our best Open
                Days ever. Thankyou to all those who joined, and happy sailing now the weather has thankfully settled down.
            </p>

                Our Open Days are an opportunity to see the Club, talk to members and, if the weather is kind, get out
                sailing with an experienced sailor. We have spare life jackets, so
                all you need is suitable clothing to wear in the boat - "suitable" of course does depend on the weather,
                however as a minimum we recommend old shoes/trainers, a change of clothing in case you get wet and a
                splash
                proof top. Unfortunately we don't have spare wetsuits, but of course you can bring your own.
