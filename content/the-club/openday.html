                Our <a href="/openday">Open Days</a> for the 2024 season will be on the <b> 11th and 12th of May</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Open Days are an opportunity to see the Club, talk to members and, if the weather is kind, get out
                sailing with an experienced sailor. We have spare life jackets, so
                all you need is suitable clothing to wear in the boat - "suitable" of course does depend on the weather,
                however as a minimum we recommend old shoes/trainers, a change of clothing in case you get wet and a
                splash proof top. Unfortunately we don't have spare wetsuits, but of course you can bring your own.
            </p>
            <p>There is no need to book, but feel free to <a href="contact-us">Contact Us</a> before hand if you have
                any specific questions. We will be posting
                more updates closer to the day on the website, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hamptonpieryc">Instagram</a>
                and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HamptonPierYC">Facebook</a>.
