        <h2>Boat Insurance</h2>
        <P>
            <b>Important</b>&nbsp; Before bringing boats to the Club,
            members must have valid third-party liability insurance with a minimum
            cover of £3,000,000 for each boat.
        </P>

        <h2>Boat Parking</h2>

            The Club reserves the right to reallocate parking or move boats as it deems necessary in the best interests
            of the Club and to comply with the terms of its Lease from the Canterbury City Council.
            Where a Boat parking or storage fee is a month or more in arrears any boat or trailer parked on club
            premises will be treated as an abandoned or unauthorised and its removal will be requested.
            Where the owner fails to remove the boat, the Club may sell the boat/trailer to recover any monies due to
            the Club. A full copy of the rules is available on the
            <a href="https://www.hpyc.org.uk/theclub/documents#rules-and-polices">website</a>.
