            <p>We have a 5-year development plan that is available on request.</p>

            <p>
                The primary focus of the Club is to be the <b>sailing club of choice for local families</b>. To ensure
                the long term future of the Club it is important to ensure that the Club remains strong with a
                <b>thriving membership</b>. To do this we feel it is necessary to firstly ensure that the Club has a
                <b>prominent local presence</b>. The best advert for the Club however is to ensure we have <b>strong
                attendances for Club racing</b>. To achieve this, the Club will provide the necessary <b>training to
                allow our members to reach their full sailing potential</b>. We will provide <b>RYA syllabus based
                training</b> covering both the on water and off water aspects necessary for <b>safe and effective sailing</b>.
