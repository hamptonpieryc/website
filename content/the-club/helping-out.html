                The Club is run "by the members, for the members". This of course relies upon each
                member, social and sailing, helping in some way. There is no fixed calendar
                and we rely upon members volunteering their time and skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                The common ways to help out are below.

            <p>Help running the canteen on sailing days. This is generally just tea / coffe / cake and simple snacks
                like toasties and pizza. Assistance is also needed running the social events - preparing, cooking
                and serving food. To get involved, please speak to Clare, who runs the social team.</p>
