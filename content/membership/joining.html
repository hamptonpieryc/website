            <p>To apply to join the club, please fill a "New Membership" form and either hand in at
                person in the clubhouse or send a scanned copy to the membership secretary at <a
                        href="mailto:membership@hpyc.org.uk">
                    membership@hpyc.org.uk</a>. Payment can be made via bank transfer, cheque or
                debit/credit card at the clubhouse - details are on the forms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Existing members wishing to rejoin should complete a "Renewal Form". Please note that late renewals
                (after
                31<sup>st</sup> March) have technically "resigned" from the club may therefore have a surcharge applied.
            </p>

            <p>Please complete either the joining or renewal form. For new members requiring boat storage, please check
                that space is available and ensure the necessary insurance is in place - details are on the form.
                For existing members with boat storage, please check that the insurance is still valid.
            </p>
            <p>For your safety, we recommend that the medical forms are also completed. These are kept securely in the
                clubhouse in sealed envelops and only opened in the event of an accident or emergency.</p>
