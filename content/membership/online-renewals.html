            <h2>Online Renewals</h2>
            <p>This year we are starting an online renewal. You should have already received
                communication about this via email and WhatsApp.</P>
            <p>This is <B>optional<b>. You may still use the paper forms as before.</p>

            <header>How this works</header>
            <p>You should receive an email with the title "Hampton Pier Yacht Club Membership Renewal". This
                is from no-reply@myclub.run. This
                is the same email address used for duties and newsletters. As always, please double
                check your spam/junk folder if you cannot find the email.
            </p>

            <p>
                To continue, click on the link in the email. The steps are
            <ul>
                <li>Confirm your post code</li>
                <li>Review the details on the form</li>
                <li>Pick a renewal option:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Renew now</li>
                    <li>Renew with changes</li>
                     <li>Sorry, not renewings</li>
                </ol>
             <li>Complete the form:</li>
                         <li>If renewing, send you payment by bank transfer, cheque or cash </li>


            </ul>
             A confirm email will be sent out once renewal has been processed and any payment
             required received. These are processed manually, so it may be  a few days before
            the email goes out.
