**9.5** ABANDONED BOATS AND/OR TRAILERS
If, at any time, any fees payable to the Club by any member or former member (whether by way of
arrears of subscription or facilities fees, dinghy park fees or otherwise) shall be one month or more
in arrears and/or a boat and/or trailer the property of a member or former member remains upon
the Club premises one month or more after the club has given the member or former member
notice to remove the vessel then the member or former member shall remove the boat and/or
trailer from the Club immediately. If the member or former member fails to remove the boat
and/or trailer then the GMC may:

- (a) Move the boat and/or trailer to any part of the Club premises without being liable for any loss or
damage to the vessel howsoever caused.
- (b) Give three months’ notice in writing by registered post to the member or former member at their
last known address as shown in the Club Register and thereafter sell the boat and/or trailer and
deduct any monies due to the Club from the net proceeds of sale before accounting for the balance
(if any) to the member or former member.
- (c) Alternatively, if the boat and/or trailer is unsaleable, after giving notice in writing as aforesaid,
dispose of the boat and/or trailer in any manner the GMC may think fit and deem the costs of
doing and any arrears as aforesaid to be a debt owing to the Club by the member or former
member.
- (d) The Club reserves the right to charge storage for the boat and/or trailer until such time as the
owner collects the boat and/or trailer or until notice has been served under Rule (b) above.

PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT:

Proper evidence is available to show that all reasonable steps have been taken to trace a member
or former member and that, when and if the boat and/or trailer is sold, if the Club is unable to
account to the member or former member for the balance of the proceeds of sale pursuant to Rule
(b) above then the balance of the proceeds of sale may, at the GMC's discretion, be placed upon bank deposit account and
retained against a claim by the owner for a period of up to six years.
