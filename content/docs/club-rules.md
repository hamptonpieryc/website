- (d) The Club reserves the right to charge storage for the boat and/or trailer until such time as the
owner collects the boat and/or trailer or until notice has been served under Rule (b) above.

PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT:

Proper evidence is available to show that all reasonable steps have been taken to trace a member
or former member and that, when and if the boat and/or trailer is sold, if the Club is unable to
account to the member or former member for the balance of the proceeds of sale pursuant to Rule
(b) above then the balance of the proceeds of sale shall be placed upon bank deposit account and
retained against the eventuality of a claim by the owner (whether he be the said member or former
member or otherwise) for a period of six years.
