On the website we publish PDFs,
but typically the originals are Word or Excel docs
tha need to be edited and republished as PDFs

There are also markdown files, which are converted to PDFs
There are several services that do this.

Normally I use https://www.markdowntopdf.com/
Or, convert to html using markdown-to-html.py, add
the line
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.hpyc.org.uk/css/pdf.css">
    <title>HPYC Equality and Diversity</title>
to the top of the html and print from a browser using save as pdf
