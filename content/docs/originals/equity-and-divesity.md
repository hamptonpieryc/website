============

Equality, Diversity and Anti-Discrimination
=======================

### March 2025

## Our Core Commitments 

**Hampton Pier Yacht Club** is committed to promoting equity and diversity in our 
policies, practices and procedures and in influencing others to do the same in our dealings with, 
volunteers, members, participants and any members of the public who are 
accessing our premises and participating in our activities, on and off water.

**Hampton Pier Yacht Club** is committed to complying in both letter and spirit with all anti-
discrimination legislation and associated codes of practice in force either now or in the future.

**Hampton Pier Yacht Club** is committed to the safe, fair and non-discriminatory use 
of social media and will actively remove any content that could be considered harmful or 
hate speach under the commonly accepted legal definitions. 

All **Hampton Pier Yacht Club** members have a shared responsibility to challenge any 
discriminatory language or behaviour and promote a fair and equitable environment for all. 

## Some Further Details 

Our policies are stated below. If you believe we are falling short of these in any way,
we encourage open and honest feedback and suggest you try an informal conversation with a club member first, who 
will hopefully be able to guide you to the correct person. If you feel a more formal 
approach is appropriate, these are documented in our "Complaints and Disciplinary Procedure" 
and "Safeguarding Policy", both of which are available on the [club documents](https://www.hpyc.org.uk/the-club/documents)
page of our website.

**Hampton Pier Yacht Club** respects the rights, dignity and worth of every person and will 
treat everyone equitably within the context of our sport, regardless of religion or belief, 
gender reassignment, sexual orientation, sex, pregnancy & maternity, marriage & civil 
partnership, disability, race, and age. 

**Hampton Pier Yacht Club** believes everyone should have  the right to enjoy their sport 
in an environment free from the threat of discrimination, victimisation, intimidation, 
harassment and abuse. We will deal with any incidence of discriminatory behaviour 
seriously, according to our disciplinary procedures and will ensure that equity is 
incorporated across all aspects of our development.  

**Hampton Pier Yacht Club** acknowledges and adopts the following UK Sport statement for 
sports equality: 

_"Equality is about recognising and removing the barriers faced by people involved or wanting to be involved in sport. 
It is about changing the culture of sport to one that values diversity and enables the full involvement of disadvantaged 
groups in every aspect of sport"_.

**Hampton Pier Yacht Club**  will ensure that anyone participating in club activities will be: 

* Able to participate to the full extent of their own ambitions and abilities  
* Assured of an environment in which their rights, dignity and individual worth are respected 
* Assured of participating in an environment in which individual differences and the contributions of all participants are recognised and valued. 

**Hampton Pier Yacht Club** believes in advancing equality of opportunity between people who share a relevant protected 
characteristic and people who do not share it by: 

* Removing or minimising disadvantages suffered by people due to their protected characteristics 
* Fostering good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not share it. 
* Embedding good diversity and inclusion practice into our decision-making processes 

**Hampton Pier Yacht Club** does not tolerate the misuse of our social media platforms 
in ways that is contrary to our commitments. However, we recognise that in many case there are honest differences 
of opinion as to what is appropriate, and we encourage the use of informal processes to resolve issues. 
Serious or repeated misuse will result in disciplinary action.
