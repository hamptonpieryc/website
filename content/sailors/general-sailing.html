            <p>
                As well as racing, our <a href="sailing/calendar.html">Sailing Calendar</a> has plenty of
                general sailing days and some cruises. On these days we always have a safety boat on the water.
            </p>
            <p>All sailing is governed by the Club's <a href="docs/HPYC_Sailing_Instructions_2023.pdf">Sailing
                Instructions</a>.</p>
            <p><span class="icon icon-flag"></span>&nbsp;
                All advertised start times are the race start time, the on-water time for General Sailing, or
                departure time for cruises. Therefore you need to arrive ideally an hour before the start time.</p>

            <p>General sailing days are chance to just enjoy being on the water or to work on your
                sailing skills. Many of the general sailing days include training sessions.</p>

            <p>On cruise days we sail outside our normal sailing area. How far we sail of course depends on the weather,
                and we normally try to include lunch or breakfast. There is always at least one safety boat following
                the fleet.</p>
