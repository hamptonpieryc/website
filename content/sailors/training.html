        <header>Sail Training at HPYC</header>
        <p>
            HPYC has a fantastic team with many years of sailing experience at Club and National level, some are RYA
            certified instructors, but all are volunteers - without them there would be no training!
            Mostly our training is free to members, and we will do our very best to accommodate your needs, but please
            be
            aware of what we 'do' and what we don't 'do'.

        <header>What we offer</header>
        <p>Our objective is to encourage and develop Club members to allow them to participate in Club activities
            Sailing and Powerboating. Many of our training sessions and workshops are free. Some may incur a small
            charge to cover basic costs,
            occasionally we need to use external services, such as First Aid Trainers these may be a little more
            expensive.
        </p>
        <p>The Club has 4 Toppers, 2 RS Visions and 1 Leader so donâ€™t worry if you do not have your own boat, for
            training purposes they are free of charge.</p>
        <p>We have allocated time in our sailing programme for courses and General Sailing/Training Sessions.
            You can learn at your own pace every time there is a race there is safety boat cover and therefore a great
            time to sail, so lots of opportunity throughout the year.</p>
        <p>
            Throughout the year we provide talks and workshops of interest to encourage you to become involved with your
            Club. These cover topics such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Use of Radio</li>
            <li>Rules of Racing</li>
            <li>Race Management</li>
            <li>Winch Operation</li>
            <li>Patrol Boat Handling</li>
        </ul>

        <header>What we cannot offer</header>
        <p>
            At this time HPYC has no direct links with any RYA RTC (Recognised Training Centre), this means that while
            the instructors can train you in sailing skills as per the RYA methods, and to the RYA standards,
            we cannot offer formal certification.
        <ul>
            <li>We are not paid to provide training.</li>
            <li>We do not provide training to the General Public, only for the benefit
                of Club members.
            </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that you will be successful in
                learning to sail!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <header>When Does Sail Training Happen?</header>
        <p>
            Sail Training for novices happens during Training Sessions and General Sailing Sessions (marked in the
            sailing programme).

        <ul>
            <li>General Sailing is also a session where any member can go sailing and there is no race a great time to
                chill out and enjoy your boat!
            </li>
            <li>General Sailing is also an informal opportunity to receive tuition from our volunteers and Instructors,
                to help you learn to rig your boat and sail.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            General Sailing Days session relies on volunteers to man the patrol boat. Tuition is free and relies on our
            volunteers, so if there is a shortage then we cannot guarantee that you will receive training.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specific training events are also advertised in the sailing programme, when our Instructors or a guest coach
            runs the session. These are more formally organised and there may be a charge. We stick to the RYA ratio of
            6 people per instructor. The canteen is often open, so come along and enjoy coffee and cake and watch the
            others do the hard work! We
            are always looking for volunteers to help out in the canteen, let us know if you are able to help.
