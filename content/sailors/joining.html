                We welcome dinghy sailors from complete beginners to expert sailors and
                our <a href="sailors/calendar">sailing calendar</a> offers a mix of racing, training, cruising and
                general sailing. Our main activity is dinghy racing, but the Club also serves as a useful base for those
                who just prefer sailing their boats in a safe, controlled environment. For new and inexperienced sailors
                there is a free <a href="sailors/training">training programme</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in joining, we recommend coming to the Club on our <a
                    href="openday">open
                days</a> or anytime we are <a href="sailors/calendar">sailing</a>. There
                is no need to book, but if you <a href="contact-us">let us know</a> in advance we can make sure
                there is club member to greet you.
            </p>
            <p>Please note that we only sail in mono-hulled dinghies. There are other clubs locally that sail
                multi-hulled boats.</p>

            <p>Never been in a dinghy? We run a training programme over the season to develop complete beginners to
                confident sailors. We start with training using our club boats, and if you don't
                have your own dinghy these can rented for a small fee as you progress.
                Our training is run by RYA approved trainers assisted by experienced sailors
                and is based around the RYA Level 2 course.</p>
            <p> All you need to get started is appropriate clothing to wear in the boat. A wetsuit is ideal, but if
                the weather is warmer a splash proof top and shorts is fine. All sailors must wear a buoyancy aid.
                Don't worry if you don't have your own as there are plenty of club ones to borrow.</p>
            <p>Once you know the basics of sailing a dinghy, one of the best ways to learn on your own is to try
                racing. Watching the way more experienced sailors set their sails, tack and gybe is a great way to pick
                up skills. This might sound a little scary, so we run races like the confectionary cup especially for
                novices, and the
                <a href="sailors/fleet-captains">Fleet Captains</a> are also there to help.

                For experienced sailors we have a full racing calendar over the full season. We race in
                slow, medium and fast fleets, with a mix of boats in each fleet, handicapped using the
                Portsmouth Yardstick.
