            HPYC welcomes dinghy sailors from complete beginners to expert sailors.
            Our sailing calendar offers a mix of racing, training, crusing and general sailing. Our main activity is
            dinghy racing,
            but the Club also serves as a useful base for those who just prefer sailing their boats in a safe,
            controlled environment.
            For new and inexperienced sailors there is a free training programme based on the RYA Level 2 course.
        <p>
            If you are interested in joining, we recommend just coming down to the club when we are sailing. There
            is no need to book, but if you <a href="contact-us.html"> let us know</a> in advance we can make sure there
            is club member to greet you.</p>

        <p>Never been in a dinghy? HPYC run a free training programme over the season to take complete beginners to
            confident sailors. We start the training on our club boats, and if you don't
            have your own dinghy these can rented for a small fee as you progress.
            Our training is run by RYA approved trainers assisted by experienced sailors
            and is based around the RYA Level 1 course.</p>
        <p> All you need to get started is clothing to wear in the boat. A wetsuit is ideal, but if
            the weather is ok a splash proof top is ok. All sailors must where a bouancy aid,
            but if you dont have your own there are some to borrow</p>
