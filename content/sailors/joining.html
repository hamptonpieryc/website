            We welcome dinghy sailors from complete beginners to expert sailors and
            our <a href="sailors/calendar.html">sailing calendar</a> offers a mix of racing, training, crusing and
            general sailing. Our main activity is
            dinghy racing, but the Club also serves as a useful base for those who just prefer sailing their boats in a
            safe, controlled environment.
            For new and inexperienced sailors there is a free training programme.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are interested in joining, we recommend just coming down to the club on our <a href="openday.html">open
            days</a> or anytime we are sailing. There
            is no need to book, but if you <a href="contact-us.html"> let us know</a> in advance we can make sure there
            is club member to greet you.
        </p>
        </p>Please note that we only sail in mono-hulled dingies. There are other clubs locally that sail
        multi-hulled boats.</a>

        <header>New to sailing</header>
        <p>Never been in a dinghy? We run a free training programme over the season to take complete beginners to
            confident sailors. We start the training on our club boats, and if you don't
            have your own dinghy these can rented for a small fee as you progress.
            Our training is run by RYA approved trainers assisted by experienced sailors
            and is based around the RYA Level 2 course.</p>
        <p> All you need to get started is clothing to wear in the boat. A wetsuit is ideal, but if
            the weather is ok a splash proof top is fine. All sailors must wear a buoyancy aid - don't
            worry if you dont have your own as there are club ones to borrow.</p>
        <p>Once you know the basics sailing a dingy, one of the best ways to learn on your own is to go out racing.
            Watching the way more experienced sailor set their sails, tack and gibe is a great for picking up skills
            This might sound a little bit scary, so we run races specially for novices and the
            <a href="sailors/fleet-captains.html">Fleet Captains</a> are there to help.</p>
