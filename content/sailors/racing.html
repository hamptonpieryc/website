            <p>
                HPYC was founded to promote dinghy racing and this remains a key part of our
                <a href="sailors/calendar">Sailing Calendar</a>.

                Our racing is competitive but friendly and we aim to make it easy for novice sailors to join in
                with the racing. To help with this, we have structured our training to include plenty of race training
            <ul>
                <li>Training on race rules</li>
                <li>Additional briefing sessions before races for novices</li>
                <li>"Fleet Captains" to help improve racing skills</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>All racing is governed by the Club's <a href="docs/HPYC_Sailing_Instructions_2023.pdf">Sailing
                Instructions</a>.</p>
            <p><span class="icon icon-flag"></span>&nbsp;
                All advertised start times are the race start time, the on-water time for General Sailing, or
                departure time for cruises. Therefore you need to arrive ideally an hour before the start time and don't
                forget you must sign in at least 45 minutes before the start (this rule is relaxed for twilight races).
                The horn is sounded as a reminder. If you see TBA as the start time in the Sailing Programme you should
                see this is the 2nd event of the day - in this situation the Race Officer will make the decision of the
                actual start time.</p>

            <header>Series Racing</header>
            <p>HPYC traditionally runs 5 series of racing: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Evening and Twilight,
                additionally there will be Novice Series to be raced at the same time as the Summer series. There
                are typically 5 races in each Series. Not all the races in each series are counted for the final
                standings, a proportion of the races are discarded to allow for duties, bad weather days etc. and
                makes for a fairer system.
            </p>
            <p>
                We race in three fleets, Slow, Medium and Fast. All sailors, whatever their skill level are encouraged
                to join in the racing - it is a great way to improve skills. Our training programme includes sessions
                on racing.
            </p>

            <header>Cup Racing</header>
            <p>There are a number of celebrated trophies in the Club, and each year we race for them! These are
                single events, but may actually be multiple races on the day. This is a great opportunity to race if
                you do not commit to racing for a full series.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just to highlight a few of the sailing events:
            <h4>Confectionary Cup</h4>

            <cupnotes>These are fun races where everyone wins a chocolate bar. It is an ideal race for novices.
            </cupnotes>
            <h4>Presidents Cup</h4>
            <cupnotes>The Presidents Cup will be a 2-race event. The Race Officer will make a decision on the day on
                the course and duration of each race.
            </cupnotes>
            <h4>Commodores Cup</h4>
            <cupnotes>
                The Commodores Cup will be a 2-race event. The Race Officer will make a decision on the day on
                the course and duration of each race.
            </cupnotes>
            <h4>Ganges</h4>
            <cupnotes>
                The Ganges Bowl is seen as a very prominent aspect of Club racing, due to its history. H.M.S.
                Ganges was a boys training ship (Seaman Training 1939-46). It was originally a Napoleonic War
                Ship. One day, talking in the Club bar, it was found that three long-standing and influential Club
                members (Fred Kent, Dave Finnis and Terry Taunton) had links to the Ganges, and it was decided
                to present the Club with The Bowl.
            </cupnotes>
            <h4>Gower Sprint</h4>
            <cupnotes>
                Richard and Christine Gower were prominent and popular members of the Club. Before emigrating
                to Australia in 2019, Dickie and Chrissy donated the ‘Blue Horizon’ trophy – the Gower Sprint is in
                honour of them and celebrates their dedication to HPYC.

            <header>Race Results and Handicapping</header>
            <p>Preliminary race results are posted on the notice board after the race. Finalised results
                will be 'HalSail'. To view these, use the link above and it will open at the series that has most
                recently had a result entered. From here you can navigate to all of the Club results using the dropdown
                menus.
            <ul>
                <li>Select the fleet you race in i.e. Fast, medium or Slow</li>
                <li>Select the Series or Cup Race that you want to see the results for.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p> As we now have multiple years results in HalSail these have been re-labelled to include the year e.g.
                Spring Series 2023. Please note that it may a few days until results are entered.
            </p>
            <p>For fair racing between boats of different abilities, most Club races are handicapped using the
                Portsmouth
                Yardstick (PY) system.</p>
