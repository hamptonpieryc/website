            <p>
                The Club owns a number of boats which members may use. The aim is primarily to enable novice members to
                continue sailing once they have reached a reasonable level of competence until they acquire their own
                boat or team up as a crew. Use of club boats is free on training days. On other days there is a
                suggested donation that is intended to simply contribute to the cost of routine maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Club boats may only be used by sailing members who have completed and signed the form below,
                copies of which are located on the notice board in the club entrance hall and in the Race
                Officers' Handbook. Boats cannot be booked in advance, and are on a first come, first served basis.
