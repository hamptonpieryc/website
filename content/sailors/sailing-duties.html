                The Club is run by the members for the benefit of the members. We do all
                we can ourselves, and like most clubs we rely on volunteers and everyone doing their bit.

                    this duty should confirm beforehand that your experience is sufficient, and be briefed on
                    the sea conditions expected at Hampton Pier. Ideally you have a PowerBoat 2 certification,
                    but this is not essential.

                <li><b>Race Officer(RO)</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;"Lay the course, brief sailors, overall responsibility for

            <p>This process relies on members volunteering for duties. There is no fixed
                schedule, but as a "rule of thumb" to be fair to others in the Club you should aim to
                perform one duty for each race series.</p>
