                The Club is run by the members for the benefit of the members. We do all
                we can ourselves, and like most clubs we rely on volunteers and everyone doing their bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sailing members are expected to undertake sailing duties during the season. The duties can vary

            <p>We use DutyMan to organise the Duty Roster. All sailing members should
                have been enrolled, in which you will already have been sent an email with your user id along with a
                User Guide.</p>
            <p>The process relies on members volunteering for duties. There is no fixed
                schedule, but as a "rule of thumb" to be fair to others in the Club you should aim to
                perform one duty for each race series.</p>
            <p>Duties are managed by the Rear Commodore. Please email if there are any
                problems or questions: <a class="mailto" href="mailto:rearcommhpyc@gmail.com"
