                There is boat storage on the grass bank to the side of the Clubhouse and also on the beach behind
                the safety boat garage. There is also a locked sail store. Spaces are limited and only available
                to sailing members. See the <a href="membership/fees">Fees</a> page for prices.</p>
            <p>
                If you are looking for a place to store kayaks, canoes or paddle boards unfortunately
                we don't have the space for these at the present. However we are looking at options
                so please <a href="contact-us">Contact Us</a> to let us know you are interested.
