            We are not just a sailing club, and welcome those who want to use the club a base for other
            activities, and those who want to socialize and enjoy the views from our bar without getting their feet wet.

            All club members have 24*7 access to the toilets, changing rooms and showers.
        </p>
        <p>More details are below.

            <p>
                The water by the Club is partly sheltered by the old Hampton Pier and a nice place to start a trip
                up or down the bay.
                Kayakers and canoeist can simply join as social members or of course with a sailing
                membership and mix both. There are no restrictions on when you can out, but we do ask that you keep
                clear of the
                dinghies during sailing events.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are looking at options for the secure storage of kayaks and canoes, however currently space is very
                limited. If you need storage please <a href="contact-us.html">Contact us</a>.

                Free parking normally possible outside peak periods or there is paid parking in the nearby Hampton Pier
                carpark.
            </p>
            <p><span class="icon icon-flag"></span>&nbsp;The Club only permits the use of non-powered water
                craft and reserves
                the right to restrict some types. <a href="contact-us.html">Contact us</a> if unsure.</p>

                For open water swimmers and paddle boarders the Club offers a convenient place to change
                and a safe, sheltered beach which is normally quieter than the main beach
                We are about 15 minutes walk from Herne Bay Pier and free parking normally possible outside peak periods
                or there is paid parking in the nearby Hampton Pier
                carpark.
