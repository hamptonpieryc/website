        <p>
            We are not just a sailing club. We welcome those who want to use the club a base for other
            activities and those who want to just socialize without getting their feet wet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enjoy the sea views from our bar and make use of the Clubhouse which is conveniently placed within walking
            distance of Herne Bay pier. All club members have 24*7 access to the toilets, changing rooms and showers.

            <p>
                The water by the Club is partly sheltered by the old Hampton Pier and a nice place to start a trip
                up or down the bay.
                Kayakers and canoeist can simply join as social members or of course with a sailing
                membership and mix both activities. There are no restrictions on when you can go out on the water,
                but it is your responsibility to make sure you are safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are looking at options for the secure storage of kayaks and canoes but currently space is very
                limited. If you need storage please <a href="contact-us">Contact us</a>.

                Free parking is normally available outside peak periods or there is paid parking in the nearby Hampton
                Pier
                car park.
            </p>
            <p><span class="icon icon-flag"></span>&nbsp;The Club only permits the use of non-powered water craft and
                reserves
                the right to restrict some types. <a href="contact-us">Contact us</a> if unsure. We ask that you
                keep clear of the dinghies during sailing events. The safety boats will only be out on the water when
                sailing events are on and only actively monitor the dingies.</p>

            <p>
                For open water swimmers and paddle boarders the Club offers a convenient place to change
                and a safe, sheltered beach which is normally quieter than the main beach.
                We are about 15 minutes walk from Herne Bay Pier and free parking is normally available outside peak
                periods, or there is paid parking in the nearby Hampton Pier car park.
                There are no restrictions on when you can go out on the water, but it is your responsibility to make
                sure you are safe.

                The Club has an active social programme through the year, including a monthly quiz,
                club dinners, barbeques and talks. Or just enjoy a drink and the sea views in the bar.
