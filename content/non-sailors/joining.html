        <p>
            We are not just a sailing club. We welcome those who want to use the club a base for other
            activities and those who want to just socialize without getting their feet wet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enjoy the sea views from our bar and make use of the clubhouse which is conveniently placed within walking
            distance of Herne Bay pier. All club members have 24*7 access to the toilets, changing rooms and showers.

            <header>Kayaks and Canoes</header>
            <p>
                The water by the Club is partly sheltered by the old Hampton Pier and a nice place to start a trip
                up or down the bay.
                Kayakers and canoeist can simply join as social members or of course with a sailing
                membership and mix both activities. There are no restrictions on when you can go out on water,
                but it is your responsibility to make sure you are safe - the safety boats will only be out on the water
                when sailing events are on.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are looking at options for the secure storage of kayaks and canoes but currently space is very
                limited. If you need storage please <a href="contact-us.html">Contact us</a>.

                Free parking normally possible outside peak periods or there is paid parking in the nearby Hampton Pier
                carpark.
            </p>
            <p><span class="icon icon-flag"></span>The Club only permits the use of non-powered water craft and reserves
                the right to restrict some types. <a href="contact-us.html">Contact us</a> if unsure. We ask that you
                keep clear of the dinghies during sailing events.</p>

            <p>
                For open water swimmers and paddle boarders the Club offers a convenient place to change
                and a safe, sheltered beach which is normally quieter than the main beach.
                We are about 15 minutes walk from Herne Bay Pier and free parking normally possible outside peak periods
                or there is paid parking in the nearby Hampton Pier carpark.
