            We are not just a sailing club, and welcome those who want to use the club a base for other
            activities, and those who want to socialize and enjoy the views from our bar without getting their feet wet.

            All club members have 24*7 access to the toilets, changing rooms and showers.

                The water by the club and partly sheltered by the old Hampton Pier and a good place to start a trip
                up or down the bay.
                Kayakers and canoeist can simply join as social members or of course with a sailing
                membership and mix both. There are no restrictions on when you can out on, but we do ask that you keep
                clear of the
                dinghies during sailing events.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are looking at options for the secure storage of kayaks and canoes, however currently space is very
                limited. If you need storage please <a href="the-club/contact-us.html">Contact us</a>.

                Free parking normally possible outside peak periods or there is paid parking in the nearby Hampton Pier
                carpark.
            </p>
            <p><span class="icon icon-flag"></span> The Club only permits the use of non-powered water
                craft and reserves
                the right to restrict some types. <a href="the-club/contact-us.html">Contact us</a> if unsure.</p>

                For open water swimmers and paddle boarders HPYC offers a convient place to change
                and a safe, sheltered beach which is normally quieter than the main beach
                We are about 15 minutes walk from Herne Bay Pier and parking is generally easier than in town -
