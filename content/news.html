            <p>
                Please come along to have some fun and to support the Club as we celebrate the new King's coronation on
                Bank Holiday Monday, 8 May, starting at 14:00. This is <b>open to all</b>, not just Club members, so
                please also feel free to circulate the attached poster as widely as you may wish to include family
                and/or friends - the more the merrier! There is no charge for
                attendance.
            </P>
            <p>
                It's entirely optional but everyone is invited to wear red, white and blue and there will be a
                competition for the best crown/hat with a royal theme, with separate prizes for adults and children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fun activities we are planning include "Pin the crown on the King", "Royal Who am I?", etc, and, as long
                as the weather lets us remain outside, Boules (Petanque) and maybe even a Tug of War!
            </p>
            <p>
                Food will, as recorded on the poster, be kept simple with freshly prepared Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Pizzas
                and Ice Cream. Vegetarian options will, of course, also be available. And please don't forget we have a
                well-stocked bar with prices that are amongst the best in town.
            </p>

            <p> There is no need to make firm commitments in advance. But, to help gauge numbers
                for catering, if you are interested in joining in it would be greatly appreciated if you would send a
                short message to the social team at <a href="mailto:socialhpyc@gmail.com">socialhpyc@gmail.com</a>.

            <p>
                The RS Fusion that we ordered last year has just arrived. This will be added to our
                training fleet and is ideally for training as is room for 2 adults, but can also be sailed
                single-handed.

            <subheader>March 2023</subheader>
            <p>
                The Club was recently awarded two grants from the "Opportunities Fund" for activities that improve the
                safety and wellbeing of the local community. &#163;200 was donated towards the cost of a replacement
                battery for the defibrillator and &#163;300 towards the new safety boat trailer.
                We would like to pass on our thanks to Grace Paget and Councillor Peter Vickery-Jones for their support
                of the Club.
